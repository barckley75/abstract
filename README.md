# Abstract

This is a small program that I wrote in JS. 
Move around the slider and wait for your abstract image.

Here an example

![Alt text](/relative/path/to/abstract/abstract.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")
![Alt text](/relative/path/to/abstract/abstract.jpg?raw=true "Example 1"


Thank you for you interest.
