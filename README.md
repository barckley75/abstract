# Abstract

This is a small program that I wrote in JS. 
Move the sliders and have fun painting your abstract image.

Here an example

![Alt text](/relative/path/to/abstract/abstract.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")
![Alt text](/relative/path/to/abstract/abstract_2.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

Thank you for your interest.
